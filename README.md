# Experimental-Framework

This branch contains code for evaluating several cryptographic primitives and different schemes. The tested functions are manuallu set up to be benchmarked. 

See the skeleton branch for a simplified and streamlined manner of benchmarking cryptographic primitives. This contains only the barebones of the framework.

the data_treatment pdf shows how the experimental results were derived using the python part of the framework.
